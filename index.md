<p>
 I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at Yonsei University. Currently, I am advised by Prof. Dongha Lee and focusing on Natural Language Process (NLP) research projects. 
</p>

<p>
  My primary research area is Natural Language Process, with specific interests in code generation with Large Language model (LLM), handling copyright problem in LMs, and question generation. 
</p>

<p>
I am also interested in backend development using springboot for servicing LLMs.
